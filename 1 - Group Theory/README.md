### Advanced (6)
Compiled list of challenges for veterans or those looking to push themselves even further! The difficulty varies quite a lot here and the challenges can go from slightly harder than intermediate to insanely tough.

---|---|---|---|---
rsa-2024|ictf round 42|neobeo|RSA|might involve a bit of number theory
romeo-and-juliet|seetf 23|neobeo|RSA|Familiarity with half-GCD recommended
Sus|ictf 23|maple|RSA|Familiarity with Pollard's p-1 or William's p+1 factorisation recommended

eRSA|ybn 24|warri|RSA|Familiarity with ECM factorisation recommended
EZpz|blahaj 24|azazo| ECC | See group homomorphisms in Elliptic Curves


### Misc (4)
misc category for challenges either involves concepts not fully covered in this workshop, or not necessarily relevant to the cryptosystems mentioned but relevant to the topic!

Chall Name | Source | Author | Cryptosystem | Details
---|---|---|---|---
gggg|blahaj 24|warri|Permutation Groups|-
Mobius|ictf round 27|maple|NA|-
MatProd|Hitcon 24|maple|General Linear Groups|-

<!-- I was planning to put Hitcon 22/Chimera in here (not to mention EZpz and eRSA take inpirations from parts of it), but it involves lattices so i'll save it for the last workshop -->
<!-- gggg was partially inspired from AZ's irrandomcible challenge in idekctf 24, but to this day i still do not understand irreps, neither am I intending to cover category theory, so it's not going to be in here -->
